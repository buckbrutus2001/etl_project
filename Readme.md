# Since we are nearing everyone's favorite holiday, Halloween, we decided on looking into Halloween costumes. We easily agreed upon Zombie costumes. 

## What are your data sources:
We wanted to learn the new class material of scraping from the web. Our first websites to try either blocked scraping (ie. Amazon.com and Jet.com) or required a password to logon (ie. Pinterest.com). We ended up using partycity.com and halloweenexpress.com to get costume information such as price, an image, and seller/company. We also wanted to provide rating but these were not available. 

## What transformations did you do:
Transform search results (HTML) into dictionary.  

## Where is data going to loaded:
Load into a Mongo DB. We chose mongodb since we wanted to have fun learning something new and we are all very familiar with SQL. 

## the team:
